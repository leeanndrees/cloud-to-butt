get-pizza
=========

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'lose weight' with 'get pizza,' as suggested by Kayla Arcata.

This is simply forked from [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt).

Installation
------------

* Download Pizza.crx ([direct download](https://github.com/leeanndrees/lose-weight-to-get-pizza/blob/master/Pizza.crx?raw=true))
* In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag Pizza.crx into the page that appears.
